<h2>My Experience so far </h2>
<span>Day:10/25/2016</span>
<p>
I voted back in the primaries, a couple months back. I was mistakenly taken to a republican primary, although the candidate that I wanted to vote for was a democrat. Nonetheless, I was left with the decision to vote for trump, cruz, and johnson. At that time, I was terribly misinformed and ended up voting for Johnson. However, after reviewing his policies, I don’t exactly agree with what he believes. Although, I must say that I don’t regret my decision. I have been silently, reading up on each candidate and their policies, and what I best feel correlates with my beliefs. (yes,  I am voting on my conscious.) Furthermore, I also want to take in consideration who I best feel is a leader.

I was in class yesterday, and I was asked what my web project is on, I told that person that it was on why voting is important. I was then informed that you can vote early at the school I attend. I consider that a score in my book. </p>
