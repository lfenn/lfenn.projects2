<h2>A Little About Me</h2>


<p>My name is K. Finn, I am currently a college student, and nonetheless a millennial. I grew up in a family that never talked much about politics, so I was never informed about what was going on around me. Furthermore, all my political opinions came from my teachers, or other mentors. Who were severely biased as well. In turn, when I turned 18 I made it my goal to make sure that I was informed whenever it came to my country. This includes, the upcoming election as well. I was inspired to make this website, because of  a project that I had in one of my classes. Nonetheless, I think that it will be fun to document how my voting process is as things move along. Thanks so much for visiting my website. 
</p> 


<p>P.S. A little more about myself, one day I want to own a pet fish called pebbles. I am an overthinker. I can count to 100 in 3 different languages. One day, I intend to go into politics in hopes of making the world a better place. I donâ€™t know maybe due to the fact that I am a dreamer.
