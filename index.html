<h2> Voting on a Fundamental Level </h2>
<p>As we have come into the age of social media, every four years around the time of the general election, we see political opinions spewed everywhere on our social media accounts. However, passionate those opinions are, passion does not parallel being politically informed. So, let's talk about voting, and what's really happening when you vote in the general election, and why even voting at the most fundamental levels is important.</p>
<h2> How Voting Works </h2>
<p>This may be a shocker but the president is not determined by the popular vote. “Yes that means that your vote does not necessarily, count towards choosing the president.” Instead, the president is determined by how many votes that the candidate receives in the electoral college. Thus, ultimately it is the electoral college that decides who is the president.
</p>
<h2>So, why should you vote?</h2>
<p>Even, though your vote does not directly count towards the president. Your vote does matter. Because, by voting you pick your state's electors. Essentially, the popular vote of a particular state, ends up deciding who the electors of that state will be. Yes, that means that one vote for one nominee or the other nominee, adds to the majority vote. The majority vote ends up picking, the electoral college, and they are who will ultimately choose who becomes the president. So in my opinion, even though your choice may seem inconsequential, it could make a big difference, and that's why you should vote.
